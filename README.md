## 🚨 Problem Statement

India is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs), but stakeholders—manufacturers, policymakers, and investors—lack clear, data-driven insights into sales performance across segments and regions. Understanding where demand is growing and which categories are leading adoption is key to capitalizing on this shift.

## 🛠 What I Did

Using real-world EV sales data, I built a comprehensive end-to-end analytics solution:

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy):** Cleaned and prepared raw data for analysis  
- **SQL:** Queried and segmented structured data to uncover key trends  
- **Excel:** Aggregated and explored data for quick pivots and validation  
- **Power BI:** Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize:
  - Vehicle category performance (2W, 3W, 4W, Public Transport)
  - Regional sales patterns across Indian states
  - Year-over-year growth trends with seasonal analysis

---

## 💼 Business Impact

- **2-Wheelers lead adoption (~50%)**, indicating mass-market potential in low-cost EVs  
- **3-Wheelers (~45%)** highlight the demand for urban shared mobility  
- **4-Wheelers and Public Transport** show untapped potential for future investment  
- Identified **top-performing states** (UP, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi, Rajasthan)  
- Revealed **consistent annual growth (2015–2020)** and seasonal demand patterns  

This dashboard helps **investors, government bodies, and EV companies** understand where the market is heading—and how to align resources accordingly.
