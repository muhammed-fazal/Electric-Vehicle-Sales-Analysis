This repository contains my **Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Analysis and Dashboard** project, completed as part of my internship at **Unified Mentor**. The goal of this project was to analyze India’s EV sales trends and deliver actionable insights using **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**.
